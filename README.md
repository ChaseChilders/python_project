# Intro

Hello! For this project I decided to recreate the Jeopardy game with an Avengers theme. I used conditions to determine if the Players' answer was correct, and ran it on a loop so it could be played as long as you want! The game board is printed before every question so the players will always know which amount to go for next.

# Requirements

I used the 'playsound' module to allow me to put sound effects after every question is answered, and also to play the Avengers theme after the players money total is counted :)

One you click play, you'll be prompted to enter a movie and money amount. If you enter the movie and dollar amount correctly e.g(The Avengers, $500) the question will appear. If it is not entered properly e.g(the Avengers, 500), the questions will loop around so they can be entered again!

Once all the questions are answered, if you want to exit the game and see your money total, type 'x' for both questions and you will be able to see your money earned and hear the Avengers theme :)

Happy playing!!
